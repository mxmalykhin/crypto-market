# Crypto Market Project ðŸš€

## Status: Work in Progress (WIP)

This project is currently a work in progress and has been made publicly available to showcase my real-world code. The primary focus of this project has been on frontend development, particularly in web design and layout.

### Tech Stack

This project utilizes a modern frontend technology stack including:

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Data Fetching**: SWR
- **Others**: React, React DOM, Lodash, clsx, and more for smooth development experience.

Dependencies like `@coingecko/cryptoformat`, `@jup-ag/wallet-adapter`, `@nextui-org/react`, and several others are also integral parts of this project, enhancing its functionality and user experience.

### Project Goals

The aim of this project is not necessarily to complete or maintain it for long-term use but rather to demonstrate my coding style and approach, especially in frontend development. It serves as a showcase of how I handle web layout and design challenges.

### Design Reference

The design inspiration for this project was taken from Figma. Here is the [design link](https://www.figma.com/file/). (Note: The link might be broken; it will be updated in due time.)

### Note

Please be aware that this project does not reflect the maximum extent of my knowledge and best practice implementations. It was developed primarily in haste and for personal use. As such, some decisions made during development were prioritized for speed over perfection.

### Additional Information

- **Linting and Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Version Control**: Husky for pre-commit hooks, ensuring code quality and consistency.

This project is a testament to my ability to work with modern frontend technologies and adapt to various design requirements. It's a snapshot of my journey in web development, highlighting my strengths in creating responsive and visually appealing web applications.
